Project

Progress
Reconvened as a group and discussed the next milestone, strategized on ways to improve how we work together, and briefly made sure we were all clear on what we need to work on separately for the next week.

Blockers + Surprises
Needed to refactor the backend code to use PHP’s PDO library to avoid SQL injections.
Changing requirements from the client for the healers search page.
Ask for specs far more consistently from the client and write more modular code in case of necessary modifications later on.

Learning Activity
Cody’s continuing to build out the backend with PHP 
Cassie made tweaks to the Figma document based on user feedback and reworking the Logo and color scheme. The figma document needs to be finalized before the frontend framework is done
Gerald is researching payment APIs like Stripe. Once he has decided on one we will begin to build it into the site
Jason has picked jQuery as the framework to start implementing the figma wireframe and is familiarizing himself with it

Plan
	Task for this week:
Research payment API like Stripe to implement client payments to healers.
Get Healers to display with proper formatting on the search page.
Handle geolocation data for users that visit the site who are not logged in.
Lock in the UX design and company branding

	Learning  activities proposed for this week:
jQuery 
Brush up on html, CSS, & PHP

	Goals for next milestone:
The whole website is functional including all the features (mapping, payment, and user functions all work).
The website is professional looking and feeling (clean mobile and web layout with consistent branding and themes).
We have determined a hosting plan for the site that meets the clients financial and technical restraints.
