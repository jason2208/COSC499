# Peer Testing Report

>## System Description
The Woo Woo Network is an online hub that connects healers with clients in need of spiritual healing services. We have developed a dashboard and a new user interface that we would like to implement. The dashboard works like a search function for the user to find other clients, healers, appointments, transactions and services information. We are also developing to update the user interface. For this peer-testing, we planned to gain some user feedback before we actually implement those interfaces.

1. The system design has good visibility of system status.
    - The header and footers of the site show everything an end user needs to see without being overcrowded or messy. Each site page also has a minimalist design that test users said was an efficient use of space and very intuitive to use. However, some icons were a bit small and could use some resizing and relocating. One test user suggested we also hold off on overloading some pages with features like rating stars on healer’s registration page.

2. The design follows real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
    - The front end of the site has a good branding with a head in an intuitive position, a search bar that makes sense and other features that fall in line with typical web conventions making the experience intuitive for end users. That being said there are a handful of design choices like the back button that should be rethought or removed entirely. 

3. The design is consistent with other platform and industry conventions.
    - Most users found the UX design of the platform to be an intuitive experience that fell in-line with real-world conventions. Pages flowed in a natural and logical order with the one exception being that some users felt that logging in before browsing healers was a hindrance and a potential deterrent. 

4. The design offers user control and freedom for users to do their actions and avoid getting frustrated.
    - The majority of users found that the design offers user control and freedom. However, a sizable portion had problems with getting the drop downs to work as expected. Therefore, they ended up getting quite frustrated when they could not get the system to do precisely what they wanted, like when filtering by enabled and disabled users.

5. The system has good user feedback
    - Overall, users were mixed on the user feedback of the dashboard and UI/UX document. The main concern is that, after making a query, the whole page had to reload. Autofill is another feature that is sorely missing and was requested multiple times.

6. The system offers interfaces that promote recognition to reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.
    - All the users found that our design promotes recognition to reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users. This is due to our filter or sorting system that makes it a lot easier for users to find what they are looking for. We also have a search bar and region location to help users navigate more efficiently.

7. The website is efficient and is designed to be flexible for both experienced and inexperienced users.
    - During the testing sessions the users mostly did not have issues with the login, register and other functions on the websites. They also navigated the websites freely and when they went over the more general tasks like browse through the remaining tabs and do their own search.

8. The design of the website is aesthetically pleasing and easy to look at.
    - The vast majority of users thought that the website’s design is aesthetically pleasing. They liked the colour scheme. There were some complaints about the alignment of views on certain forms. The main thing we need to do is restructure how the information is presented to the users.

9. When an error occurs, the system precisely indicates the problem and suggests a solution.
    - We got a relatively low grade on this question. In the sessions, we were mostly trying to tell the user verbally how to fix that if we have encountered the issues before. If we have not had the same issue before we would not be able to teach or have our system tell the users how to fix them.

10. When there is a problem with the system, there is a document that provides an explanation to help users understand how to   complete their tasks.
    - For the peer testing sessions, our main goal was to test our features and find new errors. Therefore, there were times that our systems could not tell the users how to fix it, but all the issues were recorded and will be fixed.
