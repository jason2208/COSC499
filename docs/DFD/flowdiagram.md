# Week 1 (Oct.4)
## What is DFD:
DFD, data flow diagram, is like a small map of the system. All the information inside, how they work with each other and where should they be will be stated in the diagram. The difference between level 0 and level 1 DFD is how complicated they are. While the level 0 diagram would only contain the most basic information of the stakeholders and their relationship, level 1 diagram includes more details on how the system works.
## Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD):
The main objects involved in our project are the users, healers and the Woo Woo Network website. The users would have the ability to book appointments with our healers while our website would deal with the requests.
## Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD):
There are 3 main systems in this website: account, appointment and payment system. The users and the healers can create their account in our website. The users have the ability to book an appoinment in the healer's profile. The data will be processed in the appointment system. Then a dashboard will be generated by the system where the users can select the time frame and see the location of the healer. Lastly, they will visit the payment page to finish the booking process.
