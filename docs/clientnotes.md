# Client Meeting Notes
*Notes are from Mikey (designated notetaker for the client meetings)*

## Week 1 (Oct. 1st, 2021) 
- Going over who got her mailing address
- Going over 2 step for login
- Everybody on team 0 has her number
- Gitlab has the backend src code
- She should send out a ranking of what features she wants (expect email)
- Alternate names?
- Alternate name doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/175KGbHxIUR6pLxlL-egc8o8aHFKXiS9WaBZQNrkXyU0/edit?usp=sharing
- Timeline on getting the old code running
- Estimate on how many people we need to test the site (5-10 long term testing, as well as in class testing with fellow students)
- To-do: get old code up and running before next meeting
- Discord thinks shes a robot

## Week 2 (Oct. 8th, 2021)
- All teams have the frontend working, but backend is giving everyone trouble
- Cody reached out to a previous dev to get help, said to set up .env to install dependencies, didn’t work
- Kimberlee could contact other 2 devs who worked on the backend, see if they know a trick to get it to work
- Cass’s team is thinking about reworking the backend altogether
- Cody saw the files on the db were all different types, and wants to swap the db other to mongodb
- Cass suggested having the previous team to screen record them setting the db up
- Kimberlee said she would send that idea to them
- Backend currently has a lot of features implemented, would be a pain to rebuild
- Kimberlee sent out a figma file detailing how the site would work https://www.figma.com/file/2oLK2HMwCJLuErpx9zilWb/The-Unforgotten-Ones?node-id=0%3A1
- Kimberlee has another person Cody could contact who works at Telus, she hasn't reviewed the code
- Kimberlee suggested meeting on discord next week instead of google meets
- Will be meeting in all teams discord next week
