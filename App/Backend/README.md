## Introduction
The `Backend` folder contains the files for the API. This REST api is responsible for populating the frontend with data by connecting in to the MySQL database, Google Maps API, Booking API, and payment API. 

## Setup 
1) Make sure to have PHP, MySQL, and Apache installed. On Windows, we recommend xampp to install everything once. https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2) Clone the GitHub repository into the `htdocs` folder inside your xampp/apache installation using `git clone https://github.com/GreyWolfSif/COSC499Project.git`
3) Navigate to the newly created COSC499Project to view the source code. These files can be moved to the root folder of a server to
be accessed through localhost or online.
