# Dashboard
[](../../Documentation/screenshots/dashboard.JPG)
## Introduction
The `dashboard` folder contains the files for the administrator dashboard. This is where the developers and client can securely access the database with an intuitive user interface. The main purpose is to be able to enable/disable user accounts when necessary.

## Setup 
1) Make sure to have PHP, MySQL, and Apache installed. On Windows, we recommend xampp to install everything once. https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2) Clone the GitHub repository into the `htdocs` folder inside your xampp/apache installation using `git clone https://github.com/GreyWolfSif/COSC499Project.git`
3) Navigate to the newly created COSC499Project to view the source code. These files can be moved to the root folder of a server to
be accessed through localhost or online.
