# The Woo Woo Network

## Introduction
The Woo Woo Network is an online hub that connects healers with clients in need of spiritual healing services. This is our team's capstone project that is being developed for a client.

## Evaluation
Please navigate to `docs/scrumtemplates` and click on the latest ScrumTemplate.pdf to evaluate our weekly progress. Thank you.

## Structure
- The `frontend` folder contains all the code for the front end content.
- The `backend` folder contains all the code for the back end content.
- The `dashboard` folder contains the files for the administrator dashboard. This is where the developers and client can securely access the database with an intuitive user interface. The main purpose is to be able to enable/disable user accounts when necessary.
- The `docs` folder contains all the project documentation, screenshots, sql setup queries etc.

## Setup
1) Make sure to have PHP, MySQL, and Apache installed. On Windows, we recommend xampp to install everything once. https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
2) Clone the GitHub repository into the `htdocs` folder inside your xampp/apache installation using `git clone https://github.com/GreyWolfSif/COSC499Project.git`
3) Navigate to the newly created COSC499Project to view the source code. These files can be moved to the root folder of a server to
be accessed through localhost or online.


## Peer Testing Setup (just run the front end)
1) cd to frontend
2) npm install
3) npm start
