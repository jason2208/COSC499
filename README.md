# The Woo Woo Network

## Introduction
The Woo Woo Network is an online hub that connects healers with clients in need of spiritual healing services. This is our team's capstone project that is being developed for a client.

## Structure
- The `dashboard` folder contains the files for the administrator dashboard. This is where the developers and client can securely access the database with an intuitive user interface. The main purpose is to be able to enable/disable user accounts when necessary.
- The `front-the-unforgotten-ones` folder contains the front end code as provided by the previous team of developers.
- The `woo-woo-backend-master` folder contains the backend code as provided by the previous team of developers.
- The `docs` folder contains all the project documentation, screenshots, sql setup queries etc.
