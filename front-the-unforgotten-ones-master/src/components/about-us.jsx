        services and accept payments from their clients. The project aims to
        make it easier for clients to search for healers that fit their needs
        and the interaction between client and healer as smooth as possible.

        Kimberlee conceived this project after noticing a trend with the healers
        she&apos;s interacted with in her career; that many healers find it
        difficult to market their services and accept payments from their
        clients. She was inspired by the Airbnb model of offering a service,
        reducing the conversation of money, and money being transferred after
        the service is complete. The project aims to make it easy for clients to
        search for healers that fit their needs and the interaction between
